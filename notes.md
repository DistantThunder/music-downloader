# TO DO
- be able to select multiple things at once (eg "0, 3, 5, 6") and then download this selection with ok
- add the file system as audio source
- add complete search of musify (scraping of artist page etc.) as last resort
- add a check if the songs truly are the same with non changebal attributes (length etc.)
- get additional ISRCs
- add Deezer as additional source
- add a config file where you should be able to set:
  - folder structure (genre/artist/release/track.mp3 eg.) 
  - proxies (maybe a boolean if tor should be enabled)
  - toggling of audio sources and sorting priorities of audio sources
